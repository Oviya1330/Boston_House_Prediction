# PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this solo project, I endeavored to predict housing prices in Boston by employing various machine-learning models. Initially, I utilized Linear Regression, a fundamental technique in predictive modeling, 
to establish a baseline understanding of the relationships between housing attributes and their corresponding prices. Subsequently, I explored the capabilities of Decision Tree Regression, a method adept at 
capturing nonlinear patterns within the data, to potentially enhance predictive accuracy. Furthermore, I delved into the implementation of Random Forest Regression, leveraging its ensemble learning approach to 
address overfitting and bolster the robustness of the predictions. Through this comprehensive analysis, I aimed to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing housing prices in Boston, equipping homeowners 
and real estate professionals with actionable intelligence for informed decision-making.
